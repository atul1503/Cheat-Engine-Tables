This repository contains some cheat tables that I have created for some games that I play.My cheat tables are not that organized.I have a very limited understanding of cheat engine.I have saved important instructions that access important memory addresses in the codelist.You can access those memory addresses using "what addresses this instruction accesses" on the codelist instructions.I am not a kind of hacker that worries about money,gems in games,I generally like to exploit physics engines of games to have an unfair advantage over the AI.Lately ,I have been enjoying hacking car attributes of my car in racing games like nfs most wanted,nfs hot pursuit.So you can find lua scripts that help in speeding the car in my tables.Rest is all for you to explore.
