This repository contains some cheat tables that I have created for some games that I play.My cheat tables are not that organized.I have implemented improved versions of in game features like a new and enhanced gear system for NFS MW,batsman shot booster in cricket 07,a new swing mechanism for bowlers in cricket07,gear system in gta san andreas,jumps of varying lengths in almost all gta games.I have saved important instructions that access important memory addresses in the codelist.You can access those memory addresses using "what addresses this instruction accesses" on the codelist instructions.I am not a kind of hacker that worries about money,gems in games,I generally like to exploit physics engines of games to have an unfair advantage over the AI.Lately ,I have been enjoying hacking car attributes of my car in racing games like nfs most wanted,nfs hot pursuit.Rest is all for you to explore.
